              The Data may be used solely by You for internal purposes only. You
              shall keep Your password (if any is provided to You) confidential.
              You may not share Your password with any other person. You may not
              resell or otherwise transfer or allow the use of the Data, or any
              part thereof, directly or indirectly, by or for the benefit of,
              any other person or organization. You agree to treat the Data as
              proprietary to WVB and that You will keep the information
              contained in the Data strictly confidential. You agree to take all
              steps reasonably necessary (or requested by WVB) to protect the
              rights of WVB. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may provide
              Resultant Information Services to Your clients. For purposes of
              this provision, "Resultant Information Service" shall mean a
              service or product provided by You which (i) contains information
              derived from the Data (e.g., by application of formulas,
              algorithms, or the exercise of human judgment), but which does not

              contains reasonable excerpts of the Data that constitute a
              nonmaterial portion of the Data. In this connection, portions of
              the Data comprising 25% or more of the Data items for one point in
              time or portions of the Data cumulatively comprising 25% or more
              of a complete time series for a single Data item will not be

              whether or not such portions have been so provided on one or
              multiple occasions. WVB reserves the right to determine, in its
              sole discretion, the materiality of portions of the Data
              comprising less than 25% of the Data items.
